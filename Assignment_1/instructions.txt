Welcome to You Can Do It: HTML and CSS

The first part of this class is about HTML,
the language for describing content on web pages.

HTML is called a "markup language" because you are annotating content to describe the meaning of the content. These annotations are called "tags". A tag marking the beginning of a paragraph looks like this:

<p>

A tag marking the end of a paragraph looks like this:

</p>

A marked up paragraph looks like this:

<p>This is a paragraph</p>

In your first assignment, you will use the following tags to markup a source text:

!doctype html
html
head
title
body
h1
h2
p
em
strong
a


And, we will also introduce you to HTML Entities, which are special codes for web browsers to display certain characters:

&amp;
&em;
