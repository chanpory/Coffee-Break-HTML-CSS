You Can Do It: HTML and CSS.
==================

This is a work in progress. Things will be ugly. Things will change. Things might explode. Don't worry.

About this project
-----------------------------
The goal of this project is to build a curriculum with hands-on exercises to make learning HTML/CSS easy and fun. Our hope is to also incorporate the teaching of typographic principles alongside HTML/CSS. So a more appropriate class name in the future might be You Can Do It: Typography + Front-End Development

About this class
-----------------------------

This is not a class about making web pages. It is about forming opinions, having a backbone, and making arguments. In this class you will learn how to express and communicate opinions in the form of typography via HTML and CSS.
